# memsql-installtion-on-Ubuntu-20-VM
Step by step installation guide for installing memsql cluster on single machine with one master node, one aggregator node and one leaf node.

### What is memsql ?
MemSQL is a distributed, highly-scalable SQL database that can run anywhere. They deliver maximum performance for transactional and analytical workloads with familiar relational models.

# Memsql has:
### Distributed Storage
Store and process data across clusters of machines to maximize resilience and performance leveraging memory and disk infrastructure.
### Big Data Capacity
Store petabytes of data on low cost disk and cloud storage for archive requirements while maintaining instant retrieval for fast deep analysis.
### Massively Parallel
Scale out shared nothing architecture provides a robust parallel execution engine for read and write queries delivering ultra-fast performance.
### Full Durability to Disk
Write transactions directly to disk or write to memory with full data persistence and archiving.
### In-Memory or On-Disk Tables
Use memory for transactional workloads and cleanup while using disk for historical data and analysis.
### Compressed On-Disk Tables
Column store disk compression optimizes resources for storing up to petabytes of data.
